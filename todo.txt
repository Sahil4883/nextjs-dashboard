Today I revised the topic 
6. Setting up your database 
    In which revisited my seed/route.ts and learned how to seed the table if it doesn't already exist 
    I seeded my own table named as abc in which i inserted the id name password and address and colums of it 
    I feel good after learning it as it gives me the hope of using my full potential
